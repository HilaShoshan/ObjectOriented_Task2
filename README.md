# ObjectOriented_Task2


In this project we work on directed graphs. 

we have 4 pacejes:

dataStructure- which conteins the classes: *Node- represent the graph vertexs .

                                           *edge- the graph edges .
                                           
                                           *DGraph- do functions on the graph.
                                           
                                           
algorithms-  which conteins the class: Graph_Algo-  cheack if the graph connected.
                                                     what the shortest path fron one vertex to another vertex and what the distance.
                                                     go over specific verexs.
                                                     
gui- which conteins the class: Graph_Gui-  drow the graph on the screen.

utils- which conteins the classes: Point3D- put the vertex in 3D location.
                                   Range- range of shape.
                                   StdDrow- standard drawing library.
