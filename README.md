In this project we work on directed graphs. 
this project represent a Directed Graph with algorithms to manipulate the graph. In this assignment we have developed a data structure, algorithms and Graphical User Interface. The assignment deals with the development of a data structure of deliberate weighted graph. After implement the Data structure, we implement algorithms such as the shortest path from source vertex to a destination vertex, if the graph is connected and several more. this Project contains five main classes

directed graph definition In formal terms, a directed graph is an ordered pair G = (V, A) where[1]

V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points;

A is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arrows, directed edges (sometimes simply edges with the corresponding set named E instead of A), directed arcs, or directed lines. It differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, which are usually called edges, arcs, or lines.

Project Classes

dataStructure- which conteins the classes: #Node- represent the graph vertexs .
                                           #edge- the graph edges .
                                           #DGraph- do functions on the graph.
                                           
                                           
algorithms-  which conteins the class: Graph_Algo-  #cheack if the graph connected.
                                                    # what the shortest path fron one vertex to another vertex and what the distance.
                                                    #go over specific verexs.
                                                     
gui- which conteins the class: Graph_Gui-  drow the graph on the screen.

utils- which conteins the classes: #Point3D- put the vertex in 3D location.
                                   #Range- range of shape.
                                   #StdDrow- standard drawing library.
