# The mazeof WAZE!

ObjectOriented_Task2


In this project we work on directed graphs. 

we have 4 pacejes:

dataStructure- which conteins the classes: #Node- represent the graph vertexs .
                                           #edge- the graph edges .
                                           #DGraph- do functions on the graph.
                                           
                                           
algorithms-  which conteins the class: Graph_Algo-  #cheack if the graph connected.
                                                    # what the shortest path fron one vertex to another vertex and what the distance.
                                                    #go over specific verexs.
                                                     
gui- which conteins the class: Graph_Gui-  drow the graph on the screen.

utils- which conteins the classes: #Point3D- put the vertex in 3D location.
                                   #Range- range of shape.
                                   #StdDrow- standard drawing library.
